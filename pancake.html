<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>3/4 cup buttermilk</li>
    <li>1/4 cup milk</li>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
    <li>In another bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, milk, egg, melted butter, and vanilla extract until well combined.</li>
    <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Be careful not to overmix; the batter should be slightly lumpy.</li>
    <li>Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Lightly grease with butter or cooking spray.</li>
    <li>Pour 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the surface and the edges look set, about 2-3 minutes.</li>
    <li>Flip the pancakes and cook for another 1-2 minutes, or until golden brown and cooked through.</li>
    <li>Repeat with the remaining batter, greasing the skillet as needed.</li>
    <li>Serve the pancakes warm with your favorite toppings, such as maple syrup, fresh berries, whipped cream, chocolate chips, or nuts.</li>
  </ol>
